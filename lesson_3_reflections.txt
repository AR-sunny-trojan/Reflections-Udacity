When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	You would use a remote repository when collaborating with others, working on multiple
	computers or just to back up your work in a public location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You would want to pull changes manually because its possible someone else is working
	on the same file or projects as you and your versions might become skewed.  Thus,
	you should only pull when you need it or require something.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
	Fork - When on GitHub website you clone somebody else's repository into you own
	account.
	Clone - When you make a duplicate of a local or remote repository.  Either own
	or someone else's.
	Branch - When within a repository you split up workflows.
