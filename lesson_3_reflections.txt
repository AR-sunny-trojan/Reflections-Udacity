When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	You would use a remote repository when collaborating with others, working on multiple
	computers or just to back up your work in a public location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You would want to pull changes manually because its possible someone else is working
	on the same file or projects as you and your versions might become skewed.  Thus,
	you should only pull when you need it or require something.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
	Fork - When on GitHub website you clone somebody else's repository into you own
	account.
	Clone - When you make a duplicate of a local or remote repository.  Either own
	or someone else's.
	Branch - When within a repository you split up workflows.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	Firstly, it allows you to see if any changes have been made to the remote file
	as compared to yours.  If there has, you can work offline while incorporating
	those changes in your project.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what 
would be harder?
	You could collaborate using tools such as dropbox.  It would be
	easier in that all the updates will show for everyone immediately
	and al version histories will be stored.  However, it won't let you 
	experiment as much or work on different (or the same) branches
	at the same time without conflict.  It also won't let you see
	the changes between the different versions of each file, which is
	a big big nono.
